Canelo (61-2-2, 39 KOs) remains the biggest attraction in Box𝚒ng. The 34-year-old from Guadalajara is a four-weight world champion and has been a fixture on any pound-for-pound list worth reading for more than a decade. His mission on Saturday is to turn back the challenge of his Puerto Rican rival on his country’s biggest holiday weekend.

“It’s an honor to fight on this date. Mexican Independence Day (on Monday, Sept. 16) is very important for us. It’s very special and I’m very proud to fight for the Mexican people,” Canelo said at the final press conference.

“The fans mean everything to me, and I appreciate them. They support me no matter what and I’m thankful for everyone who’s supported me throughout my career.”

Berlanga (22-0, 17 KOs) will be taking part in his first world title fight. Known as “The Chosen One”, the 27-year-old challenger made a name for himself during the embryonic stages of his career when he knocked out his first 16 opponents in the opening round. In his most recent outing, the New York-based fighter scored a sixth-round knockout over Padraig McCrory.

“[Canelo is] overlooking me, and he doesn’t respect me,” Berlanga said. “Canelo is in the way of my dreams now, I’m The Chosen One, and I’m ready to become the face of Box𝚒ng, I’m going to knock him the f— out.

“People don’t understand that I am getting better and better and better. This is the chance to prove that I am one of the best in the sport. A lot of people have a question mark on me right now. That gets removed fighting a legend and it’s time for new blood to come in and take over the 168-pound division.”
